✨ Overview

An AI-based system that suggests alternative ingredients, food pairings, and recipe ideas to help users cook smarter with what they have. Special focus is given to traditional Indian cuisine, health-conscious diets, and personalized recommendations.

✨ Key Highlights

🔄 Ingredient Alternatives – Swap ingredients based on flavor, nutrition & texture.

🍲 Food Pairing Suggestions – Discover complementary ingredients.

👩‍🍳 Recipe Generator – Personalized recipes from available ingredients.

🩺 Diet-Aware Recommendations – Supports diabetes, PCOD, pregnancy & allergies.

💻 Interactive UI – Simple frontend with React + backend powered by Flask/FastAPI.

🤖 ML-Powered – Uses similarity models & classification techniques.



🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, TailwindCSS

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI)

ML Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

APIs: OpenAI for intelligent pairing


📌Installation & Setup

🔹 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (latest LTS version)

Python 3.8 or later


🔹 Backend Setup

 Clone the repository
 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/backend

 Create a virtual environment and activate it
 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

 Install dependencies
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt

 Set up environment variables (API keys, database URL, etc.)

 Start the backend server
 
 python app.py



🔹Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies

npm install

Start the frontend server

npm start


🚀 How It Works

1.Open the frontend in a browser: http://localhost:3000

2.Enter ingredients & preferences.

3.Get AI-driven substitutions & pairings.

4.Explore curated recipe ideas.


✨ Future Scope:

1.Real-Time Ingredient Detection (Image Recognition) :Integrate computer vision models (e.g., CNNs, YOLO, or pre-trained models like MobileNet) to detect ingredients directly from images.

2.Voice Assistant Integration:Connect the system with smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.

3.Nutritional Optimization:Extend recommendations to include calorie and nutrition tracking.



The Dynamic Ingredient Substitution and Food Pairing System demonstrates how AI can simplify cooking by suggesting smart ingredient swaps, food pairings, and recipes. It helps users optimize available ingredients while supporting health and dietary needs. With future enhancements like image recognition, voice assistants, and IoT integration, the system can evolve into a powerful smart cooking companion.
